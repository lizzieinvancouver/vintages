2017,Napa,Cabernet,90.5,,,90.5,"Drought broke over the winter, with lots of vegetation and healthy vines to start the season. Good growing season turned wickedly hot in early September, with no cooling-off period, then wildfires raged in early October, raising the specter of smoke taint. Napa’s most difficult season in recent memory","WS_Napa, 89-92 (value is mean)"
2016,Napa,Cabernet,98,,,98,"The final drought-influenced vintage of the run since 2012, this time without serious heat spikes. Rockier soils and drier spots ripened first, while heavier soils allowed for longer hang time. Wines show intense fruit against the backdrop of their varying terroirs; crop still down from normal",
2015,Napa,Cabernet,94,,,94,"The fourth drought-influenced year in a row, plus a cold spell during flowering led to significantly lower yields. The smaller crop ripened quickly, though, with picking beginning in August. Quality is high but more variable than 2016 or 2013, as sugars sometimes raced ahead of phenolics",
2014,Napa,Cabernet,95,,,95,"Heavy rains in February and March gave the vines an early boost—though not enough to break the drought—and from there warm, dry conditions led to an early harvest. Quality is very consistent, with the wines showing power and depth, as well as extra aromatic range. A beautiful vintage with a distinct signature",
2013,Napa,Cabernet,97,,,97,"Practically a flawless growing season, with moderate temperatures throughout and no heat spikes or rain. Earliest harvest in 25 years started in August, but Indian summer conditions allowed growers to pick blocks as they wanted through late October. Wines brim with fruit and structure. A no-brainer benchmark",
2012,Napa,Cabernet,96,,,96,"The first of California’s drought-influenced run and a welcome return to warm, dry conditions following the rain-marred 2011 season. Record-sized crop with many stars; a solid vintage across the board marked by a tannic spine that will age well",
2011,Napa,Cabernet,86,,,86,"Rare rainy harvest proved it can happen; few sunny spots, variable quality",
2010,Napa,Cabernet,96,,,96,"Cool, steady year; wines show exceptional quality, tight, dense and layered",

2007,Napa,Cabernet,97,,,97,"Textbook year; small crop, ideal ripening, wines defined by complexity and plush tannins",
2006,Napa,Cabernet,95,,,95,"A late, cool harvest produced dense, concentrated and ageworthy wines",
2005,Napa,Cabernet,92,,,92,"Record-size crop; best are elegant and balanced, yet many are tannic and drying out",
2004,Napa,Cabernet,95,,,95,"Small crop of exceptional quality; ripe, elegant, concentrated and harmonious",
