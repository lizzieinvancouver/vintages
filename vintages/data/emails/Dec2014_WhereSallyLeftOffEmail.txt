Hi Lizze and Jehane,

I just wanted to give you both an update on how far I got with the wine grape data. I got through Burgundy, Rhone, Liore, and Italy. There is Germany and New Zealand left on my tasks that I didn't get a chance to get to. I was able to incorporate the suggestions you both had into getting the data, except for making note of missing years. 

I have returned the Broadbent book to our lab area in HUH.

Happy holidays, and good luck with the rest of the project!

Best,
Sally

Hi Sally,

Please put NA in the stars column and in the notes put 'NA - not mentioned in book.'

Thanks!
Lizzie

Should I put NA for missing years? If I do, do I do that in the year column, though that wouldn't make sense?

    Okay got it!

    As for the vintage question. Yes, I was going to try to
    extrapolate a harvest date if they had actual dates or say early
    or late or nothing. An example would be "Three weeks of rain put
    on the final dampener, the vintage extending from 16 September to
    October"( Broadbent 307). I would say early harvest or 16 Sept
    harvest date?

    Another example would be, "The South enjoyed better weather and
    its late vintage from 4 October lasted a month with large crop of
    uneven quality"(308).

        Good point about the variable vintages. If possible I would go
        with Jehane's third option (find clues) but also put the full
        range given in the notes and why you picked the number you did
        (for example, in Jehane's example you'd write '3-5 stars, but
        noted as 'unquestionably, this was a very good year.'') If you
        cannot figure out the range take the midpoint (also 4 in this
        example) and write (m) instead of (v).

        Jehane -- can you add all this info to the meta data?

        I second Jehane on everything else, including that I need more
        info on vintage process to help with that.

        Sounds like very exciting data/info in the book!

            Hi Sally,

            For the star ratings that are given as a range, I am not
            sure what the best plan is, I will have to defer to Lizzie
            on that one. Some options I see are:

            * Always choose either the highest or lowest end of the
            range, and
            denote (v). It seems that the “at a glance” section
            reports the
            high end of the range when there is variation.
            * Record the numerical midpoint of the range, and denote (v).
            * Find clues in the text as to which direction the
            vintages tended
            to swing, and record an appropriate number based on that. And
            denote (v).
            o For example, Bordeaux Red 2000 is listed as 3 to 5 stars in
            the book. It is not listed in any "at a glance" section.
            Harold's interpretation was 5 stars, (v)/variable. The text
            reads, "unquestionably, this was a very good year." In our
            definitions, "Very good" corresponds to a 4 star ranking, so
            we may want to change it to a 4 stars, (v) ranking.

            If the year is not recorded in the book (as is common
            especially for very old vintages, or some vintages in less
            well-known regions), then record NA. However, if the year
            IS recorded, but no stars are given, it is very important
            to record it as 0 (zero). For an example, see Red Bordeaux
            1932.

            For the range of harvest dates, it seems good to input
            both those start and end times (make sure to use the date
            format listed in the meta_definitions tab). Are you
            running into that type of date range frequently? If so,
            then perhaps we should split the harvest_time column into
            a start and end column. It seems like it is a fairly
            infrequent note, though?

            Yes, put “rot” in the disease column.

            Ibelieve vintage, when referring to a process, includes
            both the harvesting of grapes in a given year and the
            process of turning those grapes into wine. Of course, this
            word can refer not just to the process, but also to the
            product. There are lots of definitions and articles online
            about this; start here?—>

            Are you hoping to use particular notes about the vintage
            to determine a harvest date or something? If so, I’d like
            to hear an example. Seems like we would have to be very
            careful about that.

            Hope this helps! Thanks for all your hard work.

            Subject: Re: Wine Grapes Questions

            As I'm finishing up the wine grape data, I have a few more
            questions.

            What do I do for a star rating that is 1 to 4 stars
            (variable)? If there is no star rating for that year,
            should I put NA or just nothing?

            There was also an entry that read: the main, late, harvest
            from 24 September to 5 October, was continually
            interrupted by rain. Should I input both those dates as
            start and stop times? Does "rot" count as disease or
            should I put it in notes?

            The book also continues to mention that late harvesters
            fared the best for the Red Burgundy region.

            In addition, is the vintage process considered harvesting,
            or is it a separate process?

            Thanks,
            Sally

            Hi Sally,

            Just seconding what Jehane said (thanks Jehane!). And I
            agree if
            'wartime vintage' just means it was during a war (which I
            strongly
            guess) then we don't need to record that but putting it in the
            notes column could not hurt if you like.

            Hi Sally,

            I would record “below average production” in the
            “harvest_amount” column, and perhaps “magnificently ripe
            wines” could fit in the “quotes on stars” column, if you feel
            that quote aligns with the star ranking given? (If it doesn’t
            seem to go with the star ranking, then we would have to figure
            out another place to record it I suppose).

            Regarding “wartime vintage,” I’m not sure I understand what
            that means— could you give me the full sentence for context?
            If it only means that there was a war going on that year, I
            don’t think we care about that information (we already have
            the year recorded). On the other hand, if it means that the
            vineyard was pillaged and burned by vikings, then that would
            probably affect quantity and quality of wine, and you could
            write that in a relevant column or simply the “notes” column
            for now if nothing else fits.

            Subject: Wine Grapes Questions

            Hi Lizzie and Jehane,

            I had a few quick questions.

            1. Should I record "wartime vintage" or rarely seen?
            2. how would I record" below average production of
            magnificently ripe wines" ?

            Or are these questions irrelevant because we aren't concerned
            about the production of wine but rather the harvest of the
            grapes.

            Thanks,
            Sally
