Ok, Great‹ here is more information that may be useful when contacting the
library:

Robert Parker Jr. Subscription Service:
Commercial subscription ($199/year):
http://www.erobertparker.com/info/subagree_commercial.asp
Personal subscription ($99/year, $29/90 days):
http://www.erobertparker.com/info/subagree.asp
I can¹t tell which subscription we should have by their legal stuff, but
it seems the commercial subscription gives more extensive access. The
commercial subscription includes: "Access to 250,000+ ratings, AND the
right to reproduce the content in all marketing and sales activities (e.g.
website, social media, catalogues, retail shelves, bottle stickers etc.)²
Since our activities are not marketing/ sales, I¹m not sure what our
rights to the ratings data would be.

Wine Spectator Subscription service (about $50/year):
They have a search function on their website that only members can use. I
just signed up for a 2-week free trial of the online membership, and it
looks very nice after testing it out! There are vintage charts, by region,
for pretty much everywhere, with the equivalent of our ³at a glance² data
(though on a numerical scale, not a star scale.). And a quick ratings
search for ³Bordeaux 1870² turned up 8 tasting reviews, with numerical
scores and notes. If you would like to sign in with my free account to
poke around, it is username: jsamaha@fas.harvard.edu, pass: Treety7104
Ratings search page: http://www.winespectator.com/wineratings

Steve Tanzer Subscription Service: ($95/year)
https://www.wineaccess.com/expert/tanzer/subscribe.html
Interesting site, and claims to be independent of the wine trade/
commercial interests. Also claims ³Huge data base²‹ but no numbers on that.

I will look further into Sotheby¹s books‹ My impression, though, at least
when looking at the Sotheby¹s Wine Encyclopedia, was that it had
descriptions of points of interest in different regions, notable vineyards
and vintages, but may not have a consistent rating system or really
describe more than a few notable years, etc. I may be wrong though, and I
will look further into more books.

Best,
~Jehane

Hi Jehane,

Nice work!I am most happy to ask the libraries and explain our
reasoning! I will try to fill out an online request about it in the next
few days.

Are there no good Sotheby's books that might work for just Bordeaux or
such?

'Best,
Lizzie

Hi Lizzie,

I e-mailed a large number of experts at Christie¹s auction house
today, and received this useful reply (below). I wonder if we could
get the Harvard library to pay for a subscription service to these
professional wine review sites? (I can look into how expensive it
actually is). Seems like this is where the data is! (Hopefully, it is
a service where we could access all their data, and not have to search
vintage by vintage in some silly on-line formŠ)

Happy Friday,

Hello Jehane ­

I¹m afraid auction houses are not a good resource for you with respect
to records of old vintage ratings. Our historical use of ratings come
from the originators of such data and we do not keep records of them
as they are readily available to us via subscription service. The
major professional reviewers of wine each have subscription services.
These major reviewers are: Robert Parker Jr., Wine Spectator, Steve
Tanzer.

Best of luck with your research.

Scott

Dear Mr. Scott Torrence,

My name is Jehane Samaha and I am a research assistant in the
Wolkovich laboratory at Harvard University.

We are researching the effect of climate change on wine grapes in many
regions across the world, and are currently attempting to compile a
data set of vintage quality, by region, over the past hundred or so
years. Michael Broadbent¹s book, ³50 Years of Tasting over Three
Centuries of Wine² has been invaluable in this process. His book
provides his rankings of old wines, as well as exceptional information
on pests and diseases, as well as weather events such as droughts,
that we have not been able to obtain elsewhere.

At this point, we need to verify the data we are extracting from his
book, and are looking for a second comprehensive source of rankings
for old wines. We know that there will be variation between two
different sets of rankings‹wine tasting is, after all, subjective on
so many levels. For the sake of our research, we need to assess how
great that variation is. The possibility of averaging rankings would
also make our data stronger.

I¹ve e-mailed with several wine experts who have suggested I contact
auction houses such as Christie¹s, as auction houses would have a
great interest in keeping extensive records of old vintage ratings. Do
you know if Christie¹s keeps such a database? Or, is there anybody
else you know of who could point me in the correct direction?

I would greatly appreciate your help.

Sincerely,

Jehane Samaha
